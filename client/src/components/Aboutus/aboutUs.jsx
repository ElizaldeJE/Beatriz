                The Mexican Revolution (Spanish: Revolución Mexicana) was a major armed struggle c.
                 1910–1920 radically transforming Mexican culture and government. Although recent
                research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a
                "genuinely national revolution".[4] Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure
                of the 35-year-long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the
                presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing
                 elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection.[5] Wealthy landowner
                 Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in the 1910 presidential election, and following
                 the rigged results, revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí.
